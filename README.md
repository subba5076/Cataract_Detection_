# 👁️ Cataract Detection Using Deep Learning (Fundus + Naked Eye Imaging)

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Cataract is one of the leading causes of vision loss globally. Early detection can help reduce irreversible blindness. This project aims to automate cataract detection using deep learning models on **fundus images** and **real-time naked eye images**, reducing dependency on manual diagnosis.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a robust, real-time cataract detection system using computer vision and deep learning techniques. This system leverages CNN architectures to classify images as *cataract* or *normal*, enabling screening with minimal equipment.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **TensorFlow**, **Keras** – for building deep learning models (CNN, DCNN)
- **OpenCV** – for image preprocessing
- **Flask** – to deploy as a web application
- **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Pandas** – for data handling and visualization
